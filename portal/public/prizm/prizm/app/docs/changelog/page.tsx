// ============================================================
//  Entry data
//  ------------------------------------------------------------
//  Add a new entry at the TOP of the list when you ship a
//  meaningful change. Five tag types — keep the taxonomy tight:
//
//    component   — new component or material change to existing one
//    template    — new template or material change
//    foundation  — new foundation page or token-system change
//    design      — visual-language tweak (blur, colour, spacing, motion)
//    fix         — bug fix worth telling consumers about
//
//  Do NOT add entries for: typo fixes, doc rewordings, lint /
//  formatting cleanup, internal refactors that don't affect a
//  consumer copying components into their codebase.
// ============================================================
