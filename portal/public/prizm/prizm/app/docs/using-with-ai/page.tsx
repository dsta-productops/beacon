llms.txt first — from your local PRIZM checkout or your team's mirror if you
have one, otherwise from the repo at https://github.com/prizm-design/prizm.
They describe everything else, including how to fetch any source file you don't
already have. If you can't locate them, ask me where PRIZM lives rather than
guessing.

Working conventions:
- Reuse before you build (non-negotiable). Before creating any UI element,
  search llms.txt and lib/components-api.ts for a PRIZM component that fits.
  If one exists, use it as-is — adjust exposed props and variants only, never
  rewrite its markup or styling. If nothing fits, stop and say so, naming what
  you checked, rather than silently hand-rolling a replacement. Duplicating
  existing PRIZM functionality needs explicit sign-off from me.
- For any component, check llms/<slug>.md for props, conventions, and accessibility notes.
- For design decisions (layout, hierarchy, when-to-use), consult /docs/principles.
- Use semantic Tailwind tokens only: bg-bg, text-fg, border-border, bg-accent, etc.
  Never use raw color utilities like bg-slate-500 or text-blue-600.
- Prefer existing component variants over className overrides for visual changes.
- Match the active product zone: C3 (cyan, dense, tactical) or Enterprise
  (blue, spacious, professional). Tokens flip automatically; layout choices don't.
- Components are copy-paste. The source files at components/ui/<slug>.tsx
  are mine to copy and modify.
- Never introduce external URL references (CDNs, remote fonts, third-party scripts).

        The starter prompt above does its job at the start of a session. But over a long session,
        the AI's earliest messages are the first thing summarised away as the context fills up — so
        the specifics fade (<em>use semantic tokens</em>, <em>start from the App Shell</em>) even
        while the AI still remembers it's &ldquo;using PRIZM&rdquo;. The result is gradual drift
        away from the system.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-fg-muted">
        The fix is to give the rules a home the AI re-reads every session rather than a message it
        sees once. PRIZM recommends two complementary things for this: a project rules file the AI
        loads automatically, and a short record of the key decisions it can consult, so each new
        session starts grounded in what was already agreed.

        for example). You don't have to write it by hand — give your AI the one-time prompt below
        and it will set the file up for you. A good rules file stays short and points at the source
        rather than restating it — it captures four things:

This project's UI is built with **PRIZM 4.0** (a DSTA design system). Before
writing UI, read the current PRIZM.md and llms.txt — from our local PRIZM
checkout or mirror, otherwise from the repo at
https://github.com/prizm-design/prizm.

## Reuse before you build — non-negotiable

1. Before creating any UI element, search **llms.txt** (component index) and
   **lib/components-api.ts** (props, variants, defaults) for a PRIZM
   component that fits the need. Look by function, not by name — a "pill" or
   "chip" is a Badge; a "modal" is a Dialog; a "drawer" is a Sheet.
2. If one exists, use it as-is — adjust exposed props and variants only.
   Never rewrite its markup, restyle its internals, or wrap it purely to
   change its look.
3. If nothing fits, **stop and say so — explicitly**. Name the components
   checked and why each doesn't fit, before writing anything from scratch.
4. Duplicating existing PRIZM functionality requires explicit sign-off — flag
   the overlap and wait for a "yes, build a new one" before proceeding.

## Zone and pack

- Product zone: <c3 | enterprise>
- Extension pack: <none | rc3 | …>

## Conventions that must always hold

- Semantic Tailwind tokens only (\`bg-bg\`, \`text-fg\`, \`border-border\`,
  \`bg-accent\`, etc.). Never raw colour utilities like \`bg-slate-500\`.
- Prefer existing component variants over \`className\` overrides for visual
  changes.
- No external URL references — no CDNs, remote fonts, third-party scripts.
  PRIZM is air-gap safe and the audit script fails CI on violations.
- User-facing copy uses British English (colour, behaviour, organisation);
  code identifiers stay American.

## Canonical docs — read current source, don't recall

- \`PRIZM.md\` — the AI brief.
- \`llms.txt\` — component index. Consult before writing UI.
- \`lib/components-api.ts\` — full props / variants surface.
- \`llms/<slug>.md\` — per-component context.
- \`/docs/principles\` — HF/HCI rationale behind PRIZM's patterns.
- The raw-file fetch pattern is documented in PRIZM.md and llms.txt — use it
  to read current source rather than recalling it. If a fetch 404s, stop and
  tell me — don't fabricate a substitute.`}

              A lint rule or a pull-request review step that flags non-PRIZM usage — raw colours,
              ad-hoc chrome — catches drift regardless of what the model remembers. It's the one
              safety net that doesn't depend on context staying intact, so it's worth having even
              when the rules file is doing its job.
