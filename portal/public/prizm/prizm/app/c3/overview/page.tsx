        C3 — command and control — is for systems where operators monitor and act on real-world
        events. Examples include air defence, mission control, and other operator-facing systems
        where every second on screen matters.

      <h2 className="mt-12 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Design principles</h2>
      <Section
        title="Density over whitespace"
        body="Operators need to see a lot at once. C3 reduces padding, tightens typography, and shrinks decorative space so more information fits on screen without scrolling."
      />
      <Section
        title="High contrast for clarity"
        body="C3 prioritises legibility under sustained focus. Text contrast meets WCAG AA across all four theme variants, with AAA reached for primary text where the design naturally allows, so information remains readable across long shifts and varying ambient light."
      />
      <Section
        title="Colour carries meaning"
        body="Status colours (red, amber, green) appear consistently and never decoratively. A red badge means an actual problem. A blinking element warrants attention."
      />
      <Section
        title="Designed for dark mode first"
        body="Most C3 installations run in dim rooms. Dark mode is the primary surface; light mode is the alternate. Token decisions favour dark-mode quality."
      />
      <Section
        title="Keyboard before pointer"
        body="Every action has a keyboard path, and focus rings stay visible and unambiguous so operators always know where they are."
      />

      <h2 className="mt-12 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">A C3-only surface treatment</h2>
      <p className="mt-4 text-fg-muted">

        <Link href="/docs/liquid-glass" className="text-accent hover:underline">
          liquid glass
        </Link>{" "}
        — a translucent surface treatment for floating panels over canvas content. Operators retain
        spatial awareness of the map or feed behind a panel rather than having it occluded.
        Available in both C3 light and C3 dark; not available in Enterprise.

      <h2 className="mt-12 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">When to use C3 vs Enterprise</h2>
      <p className="mt-4 text-fg-muted">
        Choose C3 when the product is operated by trained users in sustained monitoring sessions.
        Choose Enterprise when the product serves a wider audience under normal working conditions —
        back-office applications, customer-facing tools, internal portals.
